# 2. Architectures for Neural Networks
### A. Feedforward Neural Networks
Basic architecture with input, hidden, and output layers.
### B. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Best for image data and spatial hierarchies (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).
### C. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Designed for sequence data (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs).
### D. Transformer Models
Excels in natural language processing and sequential tasks (e.g., GPT, BERT).
### E. Autoencoders
Used for unsupervised tasks like anomaly detection or feature extraction.
### F. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
Generates new data instances (e.g., image synthesis).
