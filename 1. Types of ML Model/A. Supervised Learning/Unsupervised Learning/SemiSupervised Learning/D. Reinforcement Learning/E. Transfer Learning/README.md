# A. Supervised Learning
### Regression: Predicts continuous outcomes (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso).
### Classification: Predicts categorical labels (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Neural Networks).
# B. Unsupervised Learning
### Clustering: Groups data (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).
### Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces feature space (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, UMAP).
# C. Semi-Supervised Learning
### Combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve accuracy.
# D. Reinforcement Learning
### Trains models to make decisions in dynamic environments (e.g., Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks).
# E. Transfer Learning
### Leverages pre-trained models to fine-tune for specific tasks (e.g., BERT, ResNet).
