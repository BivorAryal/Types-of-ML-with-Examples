# 3. Preprocessing Techniques
### Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and noise.
### Normalization/Standardization: Scale data for optimal model performance.
### Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features from raw data.
### Data Augmentation: Increase dataset size and variability (e.g., image flips, rotations).
